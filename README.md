## Summary

The app will have two different components:

- **Activity Feed** - simple list of calls
- **Activity Detail** - detail of a call
- **Archive** - the final user should be able to archive (and unarchive) a call. Archived calls will no longer be displayed on the Activity Feed and should have a separate Archived Tab.

- Focus on design (Pay attention to the UI/UX and transitions)
- Best React Practices
- Code Readability and Maintainability
